As part of the terms of reference, it is required to implement the logic of collecting, processing and API for issuing news on the cryptocurrency market. To do this, it is necessary: 

1. Create a cron job that pulls up the result of parsing news sites for one news item (mock data is attached) and writes them to the database.
2. Implement API methods

2.1.  News feed (see UI)

2.2 News statistics for a specific coin for a given period (the number of news per day, the ratio of news per coin to the total number of coins per day, the average sentiment per day). 

The implementation details (database schemas, API method signatures, and so on), additional functionality, and so on remain within your assumptions. However, if you still have questions or are unclear, please write! 

Stack: python, django and Prisma
